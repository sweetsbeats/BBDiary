I'm feeling burnt out.

NDA'd contract work has me fucking beat. I want to bitch about it but I'm under [b]NDA![/b]
I've been humming and hawwing about what next feature to implement into the game project; it's a toss-up
between menus, picking stuff up and chunk-based map rendering. Chunks are probably the easiest, picking stuff up 
is probably the hardest, and menus, well IDK. I'm just worried the code will be so poorly written I'll end up completely re-writing it far sooner than I should.

Recently I've been doing nothing but writing code. Some switch got flipped and it's like I can't take a break; When I procrastinate now I just jump to a different project.
I've spent barely any time playing games of watching stuff recently and it feels weird. Maybe I'll force myself to take a long break tomorrow. 

On another note, I threw up a dummy version of my [url=https://sweetsbeats-homepage.herokuapp.com/]newtab-homepage[/url] 
on [url=https://github.com/sweetsbeats/newtab-homepage]git[/url] and heroku. It has some comfy animations. I'll be back to posting normal stuff soon.
