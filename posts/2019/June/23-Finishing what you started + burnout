20 days later, and I think my burnout has fucked off. So yay for that! Things on the contract work side have
gotten a little better, and the engine has progressed a bit (but not a lot). For the past 20 days
I've admittedly done very little, and what I did blew up in spectacular fashion.

I ended up implementing chunk-based culling, which basically means if you can't see the chunk, it won't be drawn.
[url=https://files.catbox.moe/27tlf4.mp4]Here is an example of that.[/url] To give context, I've lied to the engine about the size
of the window! It thinks that the viewport is 300x200 (which it normally is), however for the example I set it to 800x600, so I could
actually confirm and then capture the logic in action.

Next up was to add more chunks to the level to test and see if it worked. [url=https://files.catbox.moe/f9vamp.gif]Turns out it didn't[/url],
so I had some fun figuring that out. [url=https://files.catbox.moe/c2c9z0.png]I got it eventually though.[/url].

As of right now, I'm part-way through working on [url=https://files.catbox.moe/uns1ml.mp4]an animation system.[/url]
In my past post animations wasn't even on the mind as I thought they would be a quick implementation I could do in an afternoon,
however after a first pass attempt I quickly came to realize that they would require be to step back and examine my options.
I'm pretty sure it won't change at this point, however I'll avoid an in depth explanation for now
in the event that things radically shift.

On a totally unrelated note to game engine stuff, I'll be starting work on an NES emulator soon (for fun), and so I may do a write up at some
point on the architecture behind it, and the adversities of recreating the NES' many quirks (Like it's fucking CPU memory mapping BS).
