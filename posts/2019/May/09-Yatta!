[b]I did it![/b]

I've talked about setting up BBDiary for ages, and thanks to heroku's sketchy (but free)
buisness model, I can now run a far better blog than my old neocities page!
I will say though, tinkering with the PHP file was a solid reminder of why I dislike web-dev.
I might dive back in and add image embedding, though I'm not sure if that's BBCode complaiant (frick the rules).

I'm still debating on whether or not to leave to fork repo I made public; On one hand it's
an easy way to having change logs, however I feel like updating the blog shouldn't count 
as code commits. On the other, other hand, (hopefully) most of the posts will be development related.
Who knows!
