Quick rant. FUCK. FIREFOX.

At some point around when the Quantum update came out, Mozilla decided it would be a good idea to remove the ability for addons to access local files, and they were right; that's a good idea!~
That solves a very obvious hole in browser security for the smooth brained among their userbase.

Why do I care though?

I like having a [url=https://files.catbox.moe/56uu0s.gif]new tab homepage[/url], and this is (and logically SHOULD be) a local webpage. Connect the dots yet? My old addon that set my new tab homepage (and others like it) have gone defunct!
So now I'm tasked with figuring out how to recreate this in FF Quantum (I did it BTW).

The first thing I did was google the issue. A lot of Reddit results, and so I bit the bullet. Let me tell you something; /r/firefox is the biggest pit of unintellegent mouth breathing drool machines I've ever fucking seen.
I mean, that's what one [b]should[/b] expect from active users of a subreddit for a FUCKING WEB BROWSER, but it still hurts to look at none the less.

Their genius solution? Host your own webserver using XAMPP! Holy shit.

Luckily on one thread, ONE post buried and downvoted, someone suggested using an autoconfig. He posted the 8 lines of JavaScript that enables the new tab homepage which worked from the browser console, and how to have it automatically
entered on startup. Dog bless this man. A saint among drooling sub-humans.
Mozilla didn't want to make this easy though! My autoconfig didn't work when I set it up, and so for the last week I've been casually dropping 30 minutes into gooling for answers, and I finally got some.

So, you want to have a new tab homepage in FireFox 67? Don't want to waste PC resources HOSTING YOUR OWN FUCKING WEBSERVER? here we go.

[code]
> Enable devtools.chrome.enabled to true in about:config
> Go to your firefox install dir
> make a file called autoconfig.js in the subdirectory defaults/pref/
> Make a file called config.js beside firefox.exe
[/code]

Copy and paste this to the contents of autoconfig.js:
[code]
pref("general.config.sandbox_enabled", false);
pref("general.config.obscure_value", 0);
pref("general.config.filename", "config.js");
[/code]

Copy and paste this to the contents of config.js:
[code]
try {
  Components.classes["@mozilla.org/browser/aboutnewtab-service;1"]
    .getService(Components.interfaces.nsIAboutNewTabService)
    .newTabURL = "file:///C:/path/to/homepage/index.html";
} catch(e){ 
}
[/code]

I'm very close to finishing engine features which will get their own post soon, so stay tuned.
If there's an issue with this, @sweetsbeats_ on twitter or something.
