This blog is a replacement for [url=https://sweetsbeats.neocities.org/]my old neocities page[/url]. 
I don't plan on taking down the old page, since I'm too lazy to move the only post there over to here.
The reason for switching was to be able to run serverside PHP, which allows me to use BBDiary; 
A neat piece of software written by a fantastic friend of mine, [url=https://prettyboytellem.com/]Yumi![/url]

I plan on using this site to create semi-frequent updates on whatever I'm hacking at, as well 
as a dumping grounds for more journal like posts.
